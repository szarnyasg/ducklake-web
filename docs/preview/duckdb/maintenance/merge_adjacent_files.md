title: Merge Adjacent Files
---

Unless [data inlining is used]({% link docs/preview/duckdb/advanced_features/data_inlining.md %}), each insert to DuckLake writes data to a new Parquet file.
If small insertions are performed, the Parquet files that are written are small. These only hold a few rows.
For performance reasons, it is generally recommended that Parquet files are at least a few megabytes each.

DuckLake supports merging of files **without needing to expire snapshots**.
Effectively, we can merge multiple Parquet files into a single Parquet file that holds data inserted by multiple snapshots.
The resulting file is a *partial data file*: per-row snapshot ownership is tracked via a `_ducklake_internal_snapshot_id` column embedded in the Parquet file, and the highest snapshot id present in the merged file is stored in the [`partial_max`]({% link docs/preview/specification/tables/ducklake_data_file.md %}) column of `ducklake_data_file`.

This preserves all of the original behavior – including time travel and data change feeds – for these snapshots.
In effect, this manner of compaction is completely transparent from a user perspective.

This compaction technique can be triggered using the `merge_adjacent_files` function. For example:

```sql
CALL ducklake_merge_adjacent_files('my_ducklake');
```

Or if you want to target a specific table within a schema:

```sql
CALL ducklake_merge_adjacent_files('my_ducklake', 't', schema => 'some_schema');
```

## Controlling Which Tables Are Compacted

When `ducklake_merge_adjacent_files` is called without a table argument, it runs on all tables where the `auto_compact` option is `true` (the default). This lets you opt specific tables or schemas out of bulk compaction calls.

> **Note** `auto_compact` does not trigger compaction automatically after writes. Compaction always runs explicitly when you call a maintenance function. The option only controls *which tables are included* when the function is called without a specific table argument.

Disable compaction for a specific table:

```sql
CALL my_ducklake.set_option('auto_compact', false, table_name => 'my_table');
```

Disable compaction for an entire schema, then re-enable it for one table within that schema:

```sql
CALL my_ducklake.set_option('auto_compact', false, schema => 'my_schema');
CALL my_ducklake.set_option('auto_compact', true, schema => 'my_schema', table_name => 'important_table');
```

With the above settings, calling `ducklake_merge_adjacent_files('my_ducklake')` will compact only `my_schema.important_table` and skip all other tables in `my_schema`. Tables in other schemas are unaffected and will still be compacted by default.

## Advanced Options

The `merge_adjacent_files` function supports optional parameters to filter which files are considered for compaction and control memory usage. This enables advanced compaction strategies and more granular control over the compaction process.

- **`max_compacted_files`**: Limits the maximum number of compaction operations produced in a single call. Compacting data files can be a very memory intensive operation, so you may consider performing this operation in batches by specifying this parameter. Note that the number of actual compacted files is highly dependent on the `target_file_size` setting.
- **`min_file_size`**: Files smaller than this size (in bytes) are excluded from compaction. If not specified, all files are considered regardless of minimum size.
- **`max_file_size`**: Files at or larger than this size (in bytes) are excluded from compaction. If not specified, it defaults to `target_file_size`. Must be greater than 0.

Example with compacted files limit:

```sql
CALL ducklake_merge_adjacent_files('my_ducklake', 'my_table', max_compacted_files => 10);
```

Example with size filtering:

```sql
-- Only merge files between 10KB and 100KB
CALL ducklake_merge_adjacent_files('my_ducklake', min_file_size => 10240, max_file_size => 102400);
```

### Example: Tiered Compaction Strategy for Streaming Workloads

File size filtering enables tiered compaction strategies, which are particularly useful for realtime/streamed ingestion patterns. A tiered approach merges files in stages:

- **Tier 0 → Tier 1**: Done often, merge small files (< 1MB) into ~5MB files
- **Tier 1 → Tier 2**: Done occasionally, merge medium files (1MB-10MB) into ~32MB files
- **Tier 2 → Tier 3**: Done rarely, merge large files (10MB-64MB) into ~128MB files

This compaction strategy provides more predictable I/O amplification and better incremental compaction for streaming workloads.

Example tiered compaction workflow:

```sql
-- Tier 0 → Tier 1: merge small files
CALL ducklake_set_option('my_ducklake', 'target_file_size', '5MB');
CALL ducklake_merge_adjacent_files('my_ducklake', max_file_size => 1048576);

-- Tier 1 → Tier 2: merge medium files
CALL ducklake_set_option('my_ducklake', 'target_file_size', '32MB');
CALL ducklake_merge_adjacent_files('my_ducklake', min_file_size => 1048576, max_file_size => 10485760);

-- Tier 2 → Tier 3: merge large files
CALL ducklake_set_option('my_ducklake', 'target_file_size', '128MB');
CALL ducklake_merge_adjacent_files('my_ducklake', min_file_size => 10485760, max_file_size => 67108864);
```

> Calling this function does not immediately delete the old files.
