DuckLake provides the option to implement all the maintenance functions bundled in the `CHECKPOINT` statement. This statement will run in order the following DuckLake functions:

- `ducklake_flush_inlined_data`
- `ducklake_expire_snapshots`
- `ducklake_merge_adjacent_files`
- `ducklake_rewrite_data_files`
- `ducklake_cleanup_old_files`
- `ducklake_delete_orphaned_files`

## Usage

The `CHECKPOINT` statement takes the following global DuckLake options:

- `rewrite_delete_threshold`: A threshold that determines the minimum amount of data that must be removed from a file before a rewrite is warranted (0...1). Used by `ducklake_rewrite_data_files`. Can be scoped globally, per schema, or per table.
- `delete_older_than`: How old unused files must be to be removed by the `ducklake_delete_orphaned_files` and `ducklake_cleanup_old_files` cleanup functions.
- `expire_older_than`: How old snapshots must be, by default, to be expired by `ducklake_expire_snapshots`.
- `auto_compact`: Whether the compaction functions `ducklake_flush_inlined_data`, `ducklake_merge_adjacent_files`, `ducklake_rewrite_data_files` and `ducklake_delete_orphaned_files` run on a given table. Defaults to `true`. Can be scoped globally, per schema, or per table.

If these options are not provided via the `ducklake.set_option` function, `CHECKPOINT` will use the default values when applicable and will run a `CHECKPOINT` of the whole DuckLake.

```sql
CHECKPOINT;
```
