title: Data Inlining
---

When writing small changes to DuckLake, it can be wasteful to write each changeset to an individual Parquet file.
DuckLake supports directly writing small changes to the metadata using _data inlining_.
Instead of writing a Parquet file to the data storage and then writing a reference to that file in the metadata catalog, DuckLake writes the data directly to tables within the metadata catalog.

Data inlining applies to both inserts and deletes:

* **Insertion inlining** – small inserts are written to a per-table inlined data table instead of a new Parquet data file.
* **Deletion inlining** – small deletes from existing Parquet data files are written to a per-table inlined deletion table instead of a new Parquet delete file.

Inlined data behaves exactly the same as data written to Parquet files. The only difference is that it lives in the metadata catalog rather than in Parquet files in the data path.

## Configuring Data Inlining

Data inlining is enabled by default with a row limit of 10. Any inserts or deletes that affect fewer rows than `data_inlining_row_limit` are automatically written to inlined tables instead of Parquet files.

### Global Default

The global default row limit is controlled by the `ducklake_default_data_inlining_row_limit` DuckDB setting. This applies to all DuckLake connections that do not have an explicit `data_inlining_row_limit` configured:

```sql
-- Change the default row limit to 50 rows
SET ducklake_default_data_inlining_row_limit = 50;

-- Disable data inlining by default
SET ducklake_default_data_inlining_row_limit = 0;
```

### Per-Connection Override

The `DATA_INLINING_ROW_LIMIT` parameter of the `ATTACH` statement overrides the default for a single connection. This setting is not persisted and must be specified on each attach:

```sql
ATTACH 'ducklake:inlining.duckdb' AS my_ducklake (DATA_INLINING_ROW_LIMIT 10);
```

### Persistent Override

The `data_inlining_row_limit` option can be persisted in the DuckLake metadata at the table, schema or global level. A persisted value takes priority over both the global DuckDB default and the ATTACH parameter:

```sql
ATTACH 'ducklake:inlining.duckdb' AS my_ducklake;
USE my_ducklake;
CREATE TABLE t (a INT);
CALL my_ducklake.set_option('data_inlining_row_limit', 10, table_name => 't');
```

## Insertion Inlining

When insertion inlining is enabled, small inserts are stored directly in the metadata catalog instead of creating a new Parquet data file. DuckLake automatically creates and manages a per-table inlined data table with the following structure:

```sql
-- created and managed internally by DuckLake; one table per schema version
ducklake_inlined_data_⟨table_id⟩_⟨schema_version⟩ (
    row_id         BIGINT,
    begin_snapshot BIGINT,
    end_snapshot   BIGINT,
    -- one column per table column, matching the table schema
    ...
)
```

`begin_snapshot` is the snapshot in which the row was inserted. `end_snapshot` is the snapshot in which the row was deleted, or `NULL` if the row is still live. Deletions of inlined rows are recorded by setting `end_snapshot` rather than creating a separate inlined deletion entry. A new inlined data table is created each time the table schema changes (e.g., a column is added or dropped), so the column layout always matches the current schema.

For example, when inserting a low number of rows, data is automatically inlined:

```sql
ATTACH 'ducklake:inlining.duckdb' AS my_ducklake (DATA_INLINING_ROW_LIMIT 10);
USE my_ducklake;

CREATE TABLE tbl (col INTEGER);
-- Inserting 3 rows – below the threshold, data is inlined
INSERT INTO tbl VALUES (1), (2), (3);
-- No Parquet files exist
SELECT count(*) FROM glob('inlining.duckdb.files/**');
```

```text
┌──────────────┐
│ count_star() │
│    int64     │
├──────────────┤
│      0       │
└──────────────┘
```

When inserting more rows than the `DATA_INLINING_ROW_LIMIT`, inserts are automatically written to Parquet:

```sql
INSERT INTO tbl FROM range(100);
SELECT count(*) FROM glob('inlining.duckdb.files/**');
```

```text
┌──────────────┐
│ count_star() │
│    int64     │
├──────────────┤
│      1       │
└──────────────┘
```

## Deletion Inlining

When deletion inlining is enabled, deletes from existing Parquet data files that affect fewer rows than `DATA_INLINING_ROW_LIMIT` are stored directly in the metadata catalog instead of creating a Parquet delete file. DuckLake automatically creates and manages a per-table inlined deletion table with the following structure:

```sql
-- created and managed internally by DuckLake; one table per DuckLake table
ducklake_inlined_delete_⟨table_id⟩ (
    file_id        BIGINT,
    row_id         BIGINT,
    begin_snapshot BIGINT
)
```

`file_id` is the ID of the Parquet data file containing the deleted row, `row_id` is the position of the deleted row within that file, and `begin_snapshot` is the snapshot in which the deletion occurred.

> **Note** Deletion inlining only applies to rows in existing Parquet data files. Deletes that target inlined insert rows are handled by setting `end_snapshot` on the inlined insert row and do not create an inlined deletion entry.

For example, with deletion inlining enabled, a small delete produces no new Parquet delete file:

```sql
ATTACH 'ducklake:inlining.duckdb' AS my_ducklake (DATA_INLINING_ROW_LIMIT 10);
USE my_ducklake;

CREATE TABLE tbl (col INTEGER);
-- Insert enough rows to exceed the threshold, so they go to Parquet
INSERT INTO tbl FROM range(100);

-- Delete 2 rows – below the threshold, stored inline
DELETE FROM tbl WHERE col < 2;
-- No new delete file is created
SELECT count(*) FROM glob('inlining.duckdb.files/**/*.parquet') WHERE file LIKE '%-delete.parquet';
```

## ALTER TABLE Support

The following `ALTER TABLE` operations are supported within a transaction that also contains inlined data:

* `ADD COLUMN`
* `DROP COLUMN`
* `RENAME TABLE`
* `RENAME COLUMN`
* `ALTER COLUMN TYPE`
* `SET NOT NULL` / `DROP NOT NULL`

## Metadata Catalog Support

Data inlining is supported when using DuckDB, PostgreSQL or SQLite as the metadata catalog.

When using a non-DuckDB metadata catalog, nested types (`STRUCT`, `MAP` and `LIST`) are stored as `VARCHAR` strings in the inlined data table. DuckLake automatically casts the values back to the correct type when reading.

Inlining of `VARIANT` columns is only supported when using DuckDB as the metadata catalog. PostgreSQL and SQLite cannot inline `VARIANT` values because the type does not round-trip through a string representation without losing type information. Tables with `VARIANT` columns will not have their data inlined when using a non-DuckDB metadata catalog.

## Flushing Inlined Data

Inlined data — both inlined inserts and inlined deletions — can be manually flushed to Parquet files by calling the `ducklake_flush_inlined_data` function.

Flush all inlined data in all schemas and tables:

```sql
CALL ducklake_flush_inlined_data('my_ducklake');
```

Flush inlined data only within a specific schema:

```sql
CALL ducklake_flush_inlined_data(
    'my_ducklake',
    schema_name => 'my_schema'
);
```

Flush inlined data for a specific table in the default `main` schema:

```sql
CALL ducklake_flush_inlined_data(
    'my_ducklake',
    table_name => 'my_table'
);
```

Flush inlined data for a specific table in a specific schema:

```sql
CALL ducklake_flush_inlined_data(
    'my_ducklake',
    schema_name => 'my_schema',
    table_name => 'my_table'
);
```

### Return Values

`ducklake_flush_inlined_data` returns one row per table that had data flushed, with the following columns:

| Column         | Type      | Description                                            |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `schema_name`  | `VARCHAR` | Name of the schema containing the table                |
| `table_name`   | `VARCHAR` | Name of the table                                      |
| `rows_flushed` | `BIGINT`  | Number of rows flushed from inlined storage to Parquet |

Tables with no inlined data are not included in the result. Example:

```sql
SELECT schema_name, table_name, rows_flushed
FROM ducklake_flush_inlined_data('my_ducklake');
```

### Time Travel and Deletions

When flushing inlined inserts that have had rows deleted, DuckLake creates both the materialized Parquet data file and a *partial deletion file*. Rather than creating one deletion file per delete snapshot, the partial deletion file consolidates all deletions into a single Parquet file with an extra column that records the snapshot in which each row was deleted. This preserves full time-travel support while keeping the number of files minimal.

When flushing inlined deletions (rows deleted from existing Parquet data files), DuckLake writes a Parquet delete file for each affected data file. If a delete file already exists for that data file, the inlined deletions are merged into it. The resulting file is always a partial deletion file so that snapshot information is preserved for time-travel queries.

For example:

```sql
ATTACH 'ducklake:inlining.duckdb' AS my_ducklake (DATA_PATH 'data/', DATA_INLINING_ROW_LIMIT 10);
USE my_ducklake;

CREATE TABLE t1 (a INTEGER);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8);

DELETE FROM t1 WHERE a = 2;
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE a = 5;

-- Flush materializes data to Parquet and creates a deletion file with snapshot information
CALL ducklake_flush_inlined_data('ducklake');
```

After flushing, time travel to snapshots before the deletions still returns the deleted rows:

```sql
-- Returns all 8 original rows
SELECT * FROM t1 AT (VERSION => 1);
```

### Sorted Flush

If a table has a [sort order defined]({% link docs/stable/duckdb/advanced_features/sorted_tables.md %}), `ducklake_flush_inlined_data` sorts the output by those keys before writing the resulting Parquet file. The sort order applied is the one currently active on the table at the time of the flush.

### Interaction with `auto_compact`

If a table has `auto_compact` set to `false`, `ducklake_flush_inlined_data` will skip it when flushing the whole lake or a whole schema. The same applies when flushing via `CHECKPOINT`, since `CHECKPOINT` calls `ducklake_flush_inlined_data` internally.

> **Note** `auto_compact` does not cause flushing to happen automatically after writes. It only determines whether a table is eligible for flushing when a maintenance function is called.
